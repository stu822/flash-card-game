# Flash Card Game

## Description
This is game that is made to help practice and build vocabulary for language learning (or anything else that involves memorizing terms). You can add cards to a deck and review them to memorize. You can also quiz yourself with the game taking the cards and putting them in to a muliple choice game.

## How it Works
The user is first presented with a clear deck. They must then add a least 4 new cards to be able to start the quiz game. They can review the cards at any time. The quiz puts whats in the deck into a multiple choice game and has the user match the correct English term (or first term) with the correct translated term (or second term). At the end of the game it gives your the percentage of correct terms.

## Technology Used
The card game uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It also uses the **Bootstrap 5** library. There is no frameworks, using only vanilla JS.
